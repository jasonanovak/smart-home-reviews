# Garage Door

My recommendation is to buy a ratgdo.

## MyQ
- My garage door opener has a MyQ client built into it and I used it
successfullly in Home Assistant for a while until [Chamberlain Group
intentionally made it less useful and blocked Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/11/06/removal-of-myq-integration/).
- I added a ratgdo to the garage door to integrate with Home Assistant.
- I would buy a dumb garage door opener and add smarts to it using one of the
below.

## [ratgdo](https://paulwieland.github.io/ratgdo/)
- This is an indy hardware ESP32 based device that you wire into your garage door opener and then adopt it in Home Assistant.
- It has both MQTT and ESPHome support.
- I would buy it again in a heart beat.

## [GoControl Z-Wave Opener](http://www.gocontrol.com/detail.php?productId=4)
- I bought this before the ratgdo was available for an old garage door.
- It is totally fine if you're in the Z-Wave ecosystem.
