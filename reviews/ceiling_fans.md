# Ceiling Fans

I'm a big fan (har har) of using fans to regulate temperatures in rooms and
have experience with two different brands.

From my research, most fans at this point are DC motored and require continuous
power, so you can't control them with a wall switch. Fortunately, many fans
now come with integreated Wi-Fi to control them with an app, and, Home
Assistant has support for many fan brands.

To have control at a wall switch location, I use a Z-Wave smart controller to
then control scenes that turn the fan's light and the fan itself on/off.

I ultimately recommend Modern Forms fans given wider variety of styles.

## [Modern Forms](https://www.modernforms.com/)
- We have a series of Aviator and Aviator 5 in both downrod and flush 
configurations.
- Overall, the brand has a wide variety of fan and lighting 
configurations to match a wide variety of styles/asthetics.
- Installation is relatively straightforward and easy and can be DIY'ed.

## [Big Ass Fans (BAF)](https://bigassfans.com/)
- We had a series of [Haiku-L](https://bigassfans.com/haiku-l/) fans that
worked decently well.
- The customer service was good and helped resolve an issue I was having with
the LED module.
- There's two different generations of Haiku-L with slight cosmetic and
assembly differences. If you're ordering all your fans at once, this shouldn't
be a problem, but, if you're adding/replacing fans over time, you may get two
different generations of fans as I don't think retailers differentiate.
